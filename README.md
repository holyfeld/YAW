Yet Another Westrum - code segments to generate a web page that gets user data on corporate culture using the Westrum Continuum. This is mentioned in *Accelerate*.

The prototype document is here:

I want to be able to randomly shuffle the facets (Orientation, Cooperation, Messengers, Responsibilities,  Bridging, Failure, and Novelty) on the web page. Within each facet, I would like to randomly shuffle the options. This hopefully will prevent users from from assuming first is worst, last is best.

And I'd like to keep track of which facets/options are selected so I can generate a report tailored to the users input.

In some way, this would be like a personality instrument (MBTI, Big 5, DISC, whatever), but for the company.

They say *You can't teach an old dog new tricks.* As an old dog, I'm going to start old timey with JavaScript. Then as time permits, I may add another solution in another language. Who knows?

Another thing I'm going to do is unit tests. These did not exist when I previously programmed (yes, that long ago). I'm going to attempt TDD to boot!
